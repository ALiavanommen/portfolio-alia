                            <p>I wanted to write, record, and release a song as a gift for my mother. This was a passion
                                project
                                of mine. After taking an ‘Audio Production Course,’ I already had knowledge of audio
                                engineering
                                and production. I had learned how to record in a studio. For this project, I chose to
                                use
                                ProTools as the DAW.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                ‘When I Miss You the Most’ was written and recorded by me. Anton helped with the
                                recording
                                and played the instruments, and Vero assisted with the production. Martin Sham mastered
                                the
                                song for me. The video was created by Valentijn van Harn. Emma took the cover photo.</p>

                            <h3>lyrics.</h3>
                            <p>The song is about my mother's passing and the feeling of missing someone, and how that
                                can make
                                me feel selfish sometimes. Because missing someone is something many can relate to, it's
                                easy
                                for others to connect with the song.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>rewriting.</h3>
                            <p>I rewrote the song multiple times before recording it. I asked for a lot of feedback from
                                friends
                                and recorded multiple demos.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>recording.</h3>
                            <p>We recorded at the ‘Mosaic Studio’ in Amsterdam. We used a tube microphone to record my
                                vocals.
                                We added some live instruments, but also used MIDI instruments.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>results.</h3>
                            <p>I ended up with a heartfelt song released on all platforms. I didn't promote it much, but
                                I
                                almost have 5k listeners! I learned a lot throughout the process.</p>

                <h3>some more about me</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a digital designer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Over the past few years, I've
                        traveled a
                        lot and taken various courses. Currently, I’m pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in
                            Communication and Multimedia Design</strong> at the University of Applied Sciences in
                        Amsterdam,
                        where I’m also focusing on my minor in Designing for Emerging Technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traveling</strong> is one of my biggest passions. I'm half German and half Dutch, born
                        in Spain, raised in the United States and having spent the last 16 years in Amsterdam, I love
                        meeting new people and exploring new places around the world.

                <h3>my design passion</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I enjoy UX and UI design, but I especially love creating <strong>immersive environments and
                            experiences</strong>. Growing up in Amsterdam, I would visit the Amsterdam Light Festival
                        and
                        enjoy all the light installations. That’s where my passion for experience design began. Telling
                        a
                        story through installations excites me, especially when they blend seamlessly with the city and
                        are
                        accessible to everyone.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also really enjoy visiting museums and love using my museum year pass. I’m especially fond
                            of
                            <strong>immersive installations</strong> in museums like 'Frabrique des lumières'.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>other things I love doing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I also have a passion for <strong>music</strong>.Check out my passion project to learn more
                        about
                        the song I released last year! I love working with artists and am often asked to record vocals
                        for
                        different songs and projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout the week, I love to <strong>dance</strong>, particularly partner dances like salsa.
                        I’m
                        also very active in my <strong>Student association</strong> called ‘Navigators’. I’m on the
                        board
                        this year, and I enjoy growing my leadership and communication skills there.</li>
