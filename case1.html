                    <h3>Challenge.</h3>
                    <p>Most people that walk into an old chuch building and see the old stained glass windows have no
                        idea what they are looking at! These windows are filled with symbolism and stories that can be
                        hard for the average person to understand.
                        <strong>The challenge was to create an Augmented Reality (AR) interface</strong> that would
                        makes it possible to understand the stories of the stained glass windows in churches.</p>

                    <h3>My part.</h3>
                    <p>Stained Glass Stories is an <strong>individual</strong> project of three weeks, so I had full
                        responsibility for the entire workflow, starting from <strong>conceptualization</strong>through
                        to the creation of the high-fidelity <strong>design flow</strong>, the <strong>UX and
                            UI</strong>, but also the <stong>prototyping</stong> process by making an AR prototype in
                        <strong>Unity</strong>. I had some feedback from teachers helping me further too.</p>

                    <h3>How it works.</h3>
                    <p>The user can use this app on a phone, Then the user can scan a window and have it analysed. Then
                        the app adds <strong>an augmented reality layer.</strong> The user then has the choice<strong>
                            what part of the window</strong> he or she wants to get explained. After selecting the
                        <strong>AR</strong> wil explain the meaning with images and text of the window to the user.</p>

                    <h3>The symbolism.</h3>
                    <p>I researched the history of stained glass windows and what the main symbols are. Then I selected
                        a specific stained glass window and did a research on the meaning of it for a prototype.</p>

                    <h3>Designing interfaces.</h3>
                    <p>I made screens through <strong>high-fidelity design.</strong> I carefully selected colors and
                        fonts, ensuring they aligned with the desired visual identity. I designed a clear onboarding
                        flow for first time users to explain how to use the AR function. Then I designed the wireframes
                        with the analysed stained glass window to create a prototype.</p>

                    <h3>Unity.</h3>
                    <p>I started building a <strong>prototype on Unity</strong>. I used a canvas and and an image of the
                        stained window as an image target. After some iterations and some trial and error I made this
                        prototype:</p>

                    <p>I ended up with these <strong>HiFi wireframes and a Unity prototype.</strong> With more time for
                        this project I would have loved to add animations and think about ways of using AI for the app
                        to analyse stained glass windows in every church!</p>

                <h3>some more about me</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a digital designer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Over the past few years, I've
                        traveled a
                        lot and taken various courses. Currently, I’m pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in
                            Communication and Multimedia Design</strong> at the University of Applied Sciences in
                        Amsterdam,
                        where I’m also focusing on my minor in Designing for Emerging Technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traveling</strong> is one of my biggest passions. I'm half German and half Dutch, born
                        in Spain, raised in the United States and having spent the last 16 years in Amsterdam, I love
                        meeting new people and exploring new places around the world.

                <h3>my design passion</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I enjoy UX and UI design, but I especially love creating <strong>immersive environments and
                            experiences</strong>. Growing up in Amsterdam, I would visit the Amsterdam Light Festival
                        and
                        enjoy all the light installations. That’s where my passion for experience design began. Telling
                        a
                        story through installations excites me, especially when they blend seamlessly with the city and
                        are
                        accessible to everyone.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also really enjoy visiting museums and love using my museum year pass. I’m especially fond
                            of
                            <strong>immersive installations</strong> in museums like 'Frabrique des lumières'.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>other things I love doing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I also have a passion for <strong>music</strong>.Check out my passion project to learn more
                        about
                        the song I released last year! I love working with artists and am often asked to record vocals
                        for
                        different songs and projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout the week, I love to <strong>dance</strong>, particularly partner dances like salsa.
                        I’m
                        also very active in my <strong>Student association</strong> called ‘Navigators’. I’m on the
                        board
                        this year, and I enjoy growing my leadership and communication skills there.</li>
