                    <h3>Assignment Description.</h3>
                    <p>The city of Amsterdam aims to make it easy for high school students to find reading books in the
                        library. To achieve this, the library has introduced a <strong>kiosk setop</strong> to help with this task. I was
                        tasked with <strong>designing an interface</strong> for this kiosk, which should be largely inspired by the
                        city's branding, but could be adapted to the needs of the <strong>target group and specific context.</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>My part.</h3>
                    <p>The "Boekenzoeker" (Book Finder) is an <strong>individual project</strong> of eight weeks, so I had full
                        responsibility for the entire workflow, starting from <strong>designing wireframes </strong>to the creation of
                        <strong>the high-fidelity design flow, the UX and UI, but also the protoyping process</strong>. I had some
                        feedback from teachers helping me further too.</p>

                    <h3>Creating the interface foundation with wireframes.</h3>
                    <p>In the initial phase of this project, I began <strong></strong>. My primary focus
                        was on designing the screen layout. Since the kiosk is located at the entrance of the library,
                        where people are constantly walking by, I found it essential to consider <strong>the time and
                            environmental context</strong> of the users. As a result, I used clear color contrast and a <strong>"one primary
                                action per screen”</strong> approach, ensuring that the interface is easily operable in such a specific
                        situation, thus enhancing usability. I drew inspiration for the design from <strong>physical
                            bookshelves</strong>, with the four vertical blocks symbolizing how books are arranged in a shelf.</p>

                    <h3>Designing a modern and bold identity.</h3>
                    <p>I started by experimenting with <strong>different design styles</strong> to explore which one would resonate best
                        with the target audience while aligning with the city of Amsterdam's branding. During my style
                        research for this target group, I discovered that <strong>"modern"</strong> is currently a key trend, especially
                        when looking at design styles of brands like Apple. Another trend I noticed among the audience
                        was the preference for <strong>bold, eye-catching designs,</strong> which are often seen in concert and festival
                        posters.</p>

                    <h3>Applying design style and refining user experience.</h3>
                    <p>After <strong>merging</strong> the design styles, I began applying the style across all pages of the app to create
                        a <strong>consistent experience.</strong> During this phase, I also focused on enhancing the user experience
                        because, through <strong>testing</strong>, I identified areas for improvement. I wanted to keep the design simple
                        and not overwhelm the user with too many steps or filters, aiming to <strong>reduce cognitive load.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Prototyping and adding micro-animations</h3>
                    <p>With the design style applied to all the app screens, it was time to make the prototype
                        <strong>interactive.</strong> I connected all the pages and ensured that every interactive element was <strong>clickable</strong>
                        with corresponding states. Additionally, a personal learning goal for me was to incorporate
                        <strong>micro-animations</strong> into the app, with the intention of positively influencing the user experience.
                        I made extensive use of these animations in the design. They support the user's actions and
                        contribute to a pleasant, engaging experience.</p>

                    <p>The "Boekenzoeker" (Book Finder) is an <strong>interactive experience</strong> that actively helps high school
                        students find a suitable reading book. <strong>The modern and bold design</strong> fits well with the age group
                        and engages the students in the search process. <strong>Smooth micro-animations</strong> assist in making choices
                        and keep the target group engaged. The "Boekenzoeker" is a <strong>comprehensive visual solution</strong> that
                        takes into account the time and environmental context of high school students, offering the city
                        of Amsterdam a way to inspire students to become excited about reading books.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a digital designer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Over the past few years, I've
                        traveled a
                        lot and taken various courses. Currently, I’m pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in
                            Communication and Multimedia Design</strong> at the University of Applied Sciences in
                        Amsterdam,
                        where I’m also focusing on my minor in Designing for Emerging Technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traveling</strong> is one of my biggest passions. I'm half German and half Dutch, born
                        in Spain, raised in the United States and having spent the last 16 years in Amsterdam, I love
                        meeting new people and exploring new places around the world.

                <h3>my design passion</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I enjoy UX and UI design, but I especially love creating <strong>immersive environments and
                            experiences</strong>. Growing up in Amsterdam, I would visit the Amsterdam Light Festival
                        and
                        enjoy all the light installations. That’s where my passion for experience design began. Telling
                        a
                        story through installations excites me, especially when they blend seamlessly with the city and
                        are
                        accessible to everyone.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also really enjoy visiting museums and love using my museum year pass. I’m especially fond
                            of
                            <strong>immersive installations</strong> in museums like 'Frabrique des lumières'.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>other things I love doing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I also have a passion for <strong>music</strong>.Check out my passion project to learn more
                        about
                        the song I released last year! I love working with artists and am often asked to record vocals
                        for
                        different songs and projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout the week, I love to <strong>dance</strong>, particularly partner dances like salsa.
                        I’m
                        also very active in my <strong>Student association</strong> called ‘Navigators’. I’m on the
                        board
                        this year, and I enjoy growing my leadership and communication skills there.</li>
