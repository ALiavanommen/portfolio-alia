                    <h3>My part.</h3>
                    <p>‘The Phone Detox Project’ is an <strong>individual project</strong> of 8 weeks, so I had full
                        responsibility for
                        the entire <strong>workflow</strong>, from <strong>conceptualization</strong> through to the
                        creation of a working <strong>prototype</strong> in
                        TouchDesigner for an exhibition. I received some feedback from teachers to help me further.</p>

                    <h3>How it works.</h3>
                    <p>The user enters the immersive room with <strong>projections</strong> on the walls. The animation
                        that is playing
                        is very overstimulating. Once the user <stong>places a phone</stong> on a box, the projection
                        changes to a
                        peaceful <strong>interactive installation</strong> where the user can ‘play’ with body movements
                        and the
                        interactive projections. This experience shows how overstimulating a phone can be and how
                        peaceful it can feel to put the phone away.</p>

                    <h3>Animation.</h3>
                    <p>I made the animation with Adobe Premiere Pro by placing many images and looping the animation. I
                        added this animation to <strong>TouchDesigner</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Phone box.</h3>
                    <p>I used an Arduino kit and a distance sensor within a specially designed box to create a ‘phone
                        box.’ Once the user places a phone on this box, <strong>the distance sensor sends the code to
                            TouchDesigner</strong>, and the data is used as a switch between the two animations.</p>

                    <h3>Interactive Animation.</h3>
                    <p>I used a RealSense depth camera to track <strong>body movement</strong>and create this
                        <strong>interactive projection.</strong> When the user moves, the projection reflects that. I
                        also added audio to the two animations and used the same data input with a switch to trigger the
                        audio.</p>

                    <p>Since I did not have an immersive lab to showcase my prototype, I used a <strong>monitor</strong>
                        with walls to create a similar experience. I printed posters with the <stong>RISO printer
                        </stong> to experiment with a different printing technique. With headphones, users could also
                        hear the<strong>audio</strong>.</p>

                <h3>some more about me</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a digital designer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Over the past few years, I've
                        traveled a
                        lot and taken various courses. Currently, I’m pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in
                            Communication and Multimedia Design</strong> at the University of Applied Sciences in
                        Amsterdam,
                        where I’m also focusing on my minor in Designing for Emerging Technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traveling</strong> is one of my biggest passions. I'm half German and half Dutch, born
                        in Spain, raised in the United States and having spent the last 16 years in Amsterdam, I love
                        meeting new people and exploring new places around the world.

                <h3>my design passion</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I enjoy UX and UI design, but I especially love creating <strong>immersive environments and
                            experiences</strong>. Growing up in Amsterdam, I would visit the Amsterdam Light Festival
                        and
                        enjoy all the light installations. That’s where my passion for experience design began. Telling
                        a
                        story through installations excites me, especially when they blend seamlessly with the city and
                        are
                        accessible to everyone.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also really enjoy visiting museums and love using my museum year pass. I’m especially fond
                            of
                            <strong>immersive installations</strong> in museums like 'Frabrique des lumières'.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>other things I love doing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I also have a passion for <strong>music</strong>.Check out my passion project to learn more
                        about
                        the song I released last year! I love working with artists and am often asked to record vocals
                        for
                        different songs and projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout the week, I love to <strong>dance</strong>, particularly partner dances like salsa.
                        I’m
                        also very active in my <strong>Student association</strong> called ‘Navigators’. I’m on the
                        board
                        this year, and I enjoy growing my leadership and communication skills there.</li>
