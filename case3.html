                    <h3>Assignment Description.</h3>
                    <p>This is the final project for the course ‘Responsive Multi-Device Design.’
                        The learning objective is to design an interactive experience that can be experienced across
                        multiple devices. We learn the theory behind digital ecosystems and the associated multi-device
                        strategies.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>My part.</h3>
                    <p>The "Budget on a go’ is an individual project over eight weeks, so I had full responsibility for
                        the entire workflow, starting from conceptualization through to the creation of the
                        high-fidelity design flow, UX and UI.</p>

                    <h3>Conceptualization</h3>
                    <p>I started with three ideas, from which I chose a budgeting app. I developed the concept further
                        with user journeys and four different user scenarios. Then, I clarified the concept by creating
                        user requirements and conducted desk research.
                        "Budget on the Go" is a responsive multi-device design that allows users to easily track
                        expenses. When the user makes a payment, such as with Apple Pay, they receive a notification
                        that allows them to save the expense to the correct budget category with one click! This can be
                        done on the smartphone and on a SmartWatch. On the browser, users can view data, adjust budgets
                        and add expenses.</p>

                    <h3>Creating the interface foundation with wireframes and wireflows.</h3>
                    <p>I began developing wireframes in Adobe XD. My primary focus was on designing the screen layout
                        for the different devices. I designed different wireflows to see what works best with the three
                        different devices</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Designing a modern and bold identity.</h3>
                    <p>I started by experimenting with different design styles to explore which one would resonate best
                        with the target audience.

                        I wanted it to look clean and easy to understand so that users of all ages could budget.
                        Budgeting involves a lot of numbers, and it’s important to visualize them well, so I also
                        illustrated some icons.

                        After choosing the design style, I began applying the style across all pages of the app to
                        create a consistent experience. I wanted to have a clean, minimal design on all devices.</p>

                    <h3>Refining user experience.</h3>
                    <p>During this phase, I also focused on enhancing the user experience and flow because, through
                        testing, I identified areas for improvement. I wanted to keep the design simple and use many
                        visualizations to reduce cognitive load. Designing for a smartwatch was especially challenging
                        because of the small screen size, so I tested and iterated a lot to find the best solution.</p>

                    <p>
                        I paid a lot of attention to visualization based on the feedback I received. These
                        visualizations were inspired by examples from visual research for example the ‘ING’ phone app.

                    <p>In the feedback, the teacher suggested using the 'overview on demand' principle. This gave me
                        more space to design better and more visual elements on mobile! By clicking on the piggy banks,
                        the user gets an overview of the respective budget.</p>

                        minimalist style while still giving users enough options.</p>

                <h3>some more about me</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a digital designer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Over the past few years, I've
                        traveled a
                        lot and taken various courses. Currently, I’m pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in
                            Communication and Multimedia Design</strong> at the University of Applied Sciences in
                        Amsterdam,
                        where I’m also focusing on my minor in Designing for Emerging Technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traveling</strong> is one of my biggest passions. I'm half German and half Dutch, born
                        in Spain, raised in the United States and having spent the last 16 years in Amsterdam, I love
                        meeting new people and exploring new places around the world.

                <h3>my design passion</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I enjoy UX and UI design, but I especially love creating <strong>immersive environments and
                            experiences</strong>. Growing up in Amsterdam, I would visit the Amsterdam Light Festival
                        and
                        enjoy all the light installations. That’s where my passion for experience design began. Telling
                        a
                        story through installations excites me, especially when they blend seamlessly with the city and
                        are
                        accessible to everyone.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also really enjoy visiting museums and love using my museum year pass. I’m especially fond
                            of
                            <strong>immersive installations</strong> in museums like 'Frabrique des lumières'.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>other things I love doing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I also have a passion for <strong>music</strong>.Check out my passion project to learn more
                        about
                        the song I released last year! I love working with artists and am often asked to record vocals
                        for
                        different songs and projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout the week, I love to <strong>dance</strong>, particularly partner dances like salsa.
                        I’m
                        also very active in my <strong>Student association</strong> called ‘Navigators’. I’m on the
                        board
                        this year, and I enjoy growing my leadership and communication skills there.</li>
